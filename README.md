EDIT 18/6
Since you mentioned enjoying Don't Drink and Dive — and because it’s a game I’m particularly proud of — I’ve included the scripts for the harpoon and rock-dragging mechanics, as well as the one controlling the first boss (McBandito Pike).

All of these were written during the one-week jam. I’ve only cleaned up unused code, and added some new comments, and while I know some areas could be better structured or optimized, I chose to leave the code as-is to give you a realistic sense of how I work under pressure. It’s very much “make it work, make it bug-free, move on” — the kind of approach necessary in a jam but which I understand needs refinement in a studio setting.

I’ve also included the GameManager singleton from The Secret Scoffer of Saffron Walden — a personal favourite of my games that placed 6th out of 521 in GitHub’s GameOff. It shows how I approached saving/loading (in this case via PlayerPrefs, which was sufficient for the jam, though I’d use JSON or a more robust method in production) - This script has obvious seperation of concerns issues (all of the Bard handling - for instance - should definitely have its own class. The entire Bard feature was added late in development when I realised that a 'boss' was necessary to round off the gameplay loop in a nice way, and I put it here because it worked for the jam purposes in the time I had left). There are also things in Update that should have their own classes or functions. Again, left as-was when I submitted the jam. 

In short, while this may read as “jam code,” I’m fully aware of the best practices I’m bypassing here (Seperation of concerns/public variables that should be Serialized private variables/lack of comments/occasional unhelpful variable and function names, over use of Update calls). My jam approach prioritizes polish, stability, and rapid feature delivery. In a studio context, my focus would be clean, modular, and maintainable code from the outset.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
